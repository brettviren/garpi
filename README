Gaudi And Related Projects Installer

Garpi is a high level script on top of Garpi's LCGCMT-based
installation and configuration.  It uses LCGCMT's builders and
interfaces packages and a starting project to automatically determine
which external packages are needed, downloads their source and
installs it.
